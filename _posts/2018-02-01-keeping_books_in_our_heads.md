I was 16 in 2015. At that time, I was working on a business project with four of my friends. It was basically about making SNS we thought would be better than Facebook -- the project idea is too awful to mention. I was in charge of leading the team and developing the android application. One day, one of my teammates recommended the book, '마크 저커버그의 초고속 업무술', saying that it would give me insights into starting a business. It was about Mark Zuckerberg making Facebook, running the company, and chaing the world. In retrospect, the book changed my life. 

I barely remember the whole content of the book. However, I definitely learned a lesson from Mark Zuckerberg's attitude toward money and vision. His pure love for his vision rather than money excited my passion to change the world. Yes, I remember it was a watershed moment for my life to dream of "changing the world". 

Since then, I began to read two books every week. And it became some kind of obsession to buy books. Not reading books made the week feel empty. Even a week before my exams, I read books to cheer myself up and have a rest. 

At last, two years ago, I read over a hundred books -- mainly about programming, science, business, and self-improvement in a year. 

Yes, it sounds wonderful. However, the problem is that I don't remember them that much. Fortunately, I do remember key points of the books like I did Mark Zuckerbug book. But not keeping all the valuable information in my heads is a waste. That's one of the reasons I decided to make this blog. I'd love to summarize the books I've read so far, and share them with my readers. If I'm too busy working on some projects or preparing for exams, I will share even some "chapers" of the books worth spreading. 


I hope you earn inestimable lessons from books.
